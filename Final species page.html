          <ul>
		    <li> Two-fingered sloths are significantly larger than their three-fingered counterparts. </li>
			  <li>They possess a long, pig-like snout and are only capable of sweating from the tip of their nose.</li>
			  <li>Their hands and feet have soft, hairless palms and soles.</li>
			  <li>They have long, brown hair</li>
			  <li>Two-fingered sloths are more active and generally faster-moving than three-fingered sloths.</li>
		  </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="oyyyy">Linnaeus's two-toed sloth is <strong>commonly kept in zoos</strong> around the world <br>
          because it is relatively easy to export them from the countries where they naturally live. </p>

		  Pale-throated sloth (Bradypus tridactylus) | Brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus)		  </p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>All four species feature small, rounded heads, tiny ears, and a constant smile.</li>
			  <li>Three of the four species are distinguished by a dark mask around their eyes, other than maned sloths.</li>
			  <li>They have short, stubby tails about 6–7 cm long (around 2.5 inches)  along with three long fingers on each limb.</li>
			  <li>Three-fingered sloths have very long arms– twice as long as their legs!</li>
			  <li>Three-fingered sloths have fewer ribs (28) than two-fingered (46)</li>
			  <li>They have  nine neck vertebrae while almost all the other mammals have seven of them.</li>

		  <p class="oyyyy">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="oyyyy">Brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus) is probably <strong>the most well-known</strong> of all sloths.<br>
		  Pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus) are one of the <strong>most critically endangered</strong> mammals in the world. </p>
