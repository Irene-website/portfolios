			Hi, my name Terry. I am a software engineer at Google, currently navigating the tech world from Sunnyvale, CA. I love solving problems, optimizing solutions, and occasionally getting sidetracked by completely unrelated but fascinating thoughts (like how my dog might actually be the cutest living being on Earth).

I don’t just write code — I think in it. Whether it’s designing efficient systems or figuring out why my brain won’t stop debugging life itself, I approach every challenge with curiosity, humor, and maybe a little too much overthinking.

		<p>I grew up in Taiwan and moved to the U.S. after my first year at National Tsing Hua University. I spent two years at Northern Virginia Community College before transferring to UVA, where I finally made peace with the fact that I’m happiest when building things (especially things that work).

My path wasn’t linear. I tried music, mechanical engineering, general engineering, and even sales. Each step gave me something — perspective, skills, or at least a good story — and brought me closer to where I am now.

I’m still figuring it out. Still curious. Still occasionally lost in thought about something unrelated, like the structural integrity of spaghetti bridges.

Skills... According to Me		
		
	  </h3>
		
		<ul>
		  <li>
		    
		    Programming Languages: Mostly C++, but I speak a few other dialects of chaos
	      </li>
		  <li>Problem-Solving: Turning complex messes into clean solutions		  </li>
		  <li>Debugging: Both in code and in life (the latter takes longer)</li>
		  <li> Teamwork: I enjoy learning from smart people and occasionally pretending I’m one of them		  </li>
		  <li>Efficiency: Making things faster, smoother, and ideally break less </li>

	  <h3 class="h33">What Drives Me

	  </h3>
		<p>
		I bring a mix of logic, creativity, and stubbornness to everything I do. For me, coding isn’t just a job — it’s the best way I’ve found to explore ideas, solve puzzles, and occasionally impress my dog (who remains unimpressed).

I want to build tools that simplify the complex, and products that feel as good to use as they do to build. And maybe, someday, I’ll actually finish a blog post that makes it out of my drafts folder.

		  <ul>
		    <li>
		      
	        I over-optimize everyday things for fun (and for no reason).</li>
		    <li>I like to annoy my dog on purpose. She tolerates me. Kind of.	    </li>
		    <li>I go on tangents that somehow circle back to programming.	    </li>
		    <li>I forget what I was saying mid-sentence but remember which line caused the bug. </li>
